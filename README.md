## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should runs using Python versions 3.*

Additional libraries:
- Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Sciki-Learn
- Natural Language Process Libraries: NLTK, Spacy
- SQLlite Database Libraries: SQLalchemy
- Classification Interpretation Libraries: Eli5 ans Lime


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my Clapstone project for the Udacity Nanodegree "Data Science".
For this project, I was interestested in using Waze data from 2019 and 2020 form the Apple Store to better understand:

1. Which are the most suitable models to predict the ratings on a dataset containing app reviews?
2. What is the highest accuracy we can be achieved by the classification models?
3. What is the highest achievable accuracy by a human on this task?
4. How to add intepretability of the classification?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  The file with the manual classification of the reviews is in the data folder.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@soniafogari/app-rating-prediction-there-is-space-for-interpretation-636821dc276d).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to the app "Appbot.co" to select and download the data and to Udacity to provide all the information, knowledge and feedback to complete this Clapstone project.
Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
